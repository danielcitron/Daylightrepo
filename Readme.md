E. Daylight: Organize Your Inspiration

Daylight is designed to be an online space for organizing what inspires you. The site is broken down into boards, allowing the user to create different boards for different projects, subjects or anything they'd like. The user can share their boards with others and others can collaborate with them by adding their own blocks. Blocks can be text or images. The user can subscribe to others boards as well.

G. Known bugs: Due to my server providers unwillingness to open the correct ports, password reset emails cannot be sent. No workaround necessary for normal use, unless you forget your password, that is.
